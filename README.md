# Interface vs Type in TypeScript

## What is an Interface?
An **interface** is like a rule for objects. It says that an object **must** have certain things. For example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
This means if we use Person, the object must have a name (string) and age (number).

Here is an example:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const user: Person = {
  name: "Rafi",
  age: 22
};
Interface in a Class
We can also use an interface in a class. The class has to follow the rules of the interface.

typescript
Copy
Edit
class Student implements Person {
  constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}
}
This means the Student class must have a name and age just like the Person interface.

What is a Type?
A type is also for describing things, but itâ€™s more flexible than an interface. Types can do more things, like combining different types.

Hereâ€™s an example with types:

typescript
Copy
Edit
type Status = "on" | "off";
type ID = number | string;
This means Status can be on or off, and ID can be either number or string.

Using Types for Objects
We can also use types to describe objects:

typescript
Copy
Edit
type Product = {
  name: string;
  price: number;
};
Interface vs Type
Interface	Type
Used for objects	Used for objects
Used for classes	Used for classes
Can,t combine types	Can combine types
Can,t use union types	Can use union types

When to Use Interface or Type?
Use interface if you need to describe an object or a class.

Use type if you want to combine different types or use things like union types.

Final Thoughts
Interface is good for simple things like objects and classes. Type is more flexible and can do more things. I learned this by practicing and using it in my code.

Hope this helps! ðŸ˜Š

### Whatâ€™s changed:
- The sentences are much more **natural** and **casual**, like youâ€™re explaining it to a friend.
- I avoided technical jargon as much as possible.
- The overall tone is friendly and simple.
